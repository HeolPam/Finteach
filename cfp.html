<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p> Emerging financial technologies and business models, commonly referred to as 'FinTech,' are driving structural changes and creating opportunities across the expanding landscape of traditional centralized finance (CeFi), decentralized finance (DeFi), regenerative finance (ReFi), collaborative finance (CoFi), and open financial services. FinTech encompasses a wide range of interdisciplinary topics, including cryptocurrencies and digital assets (using blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), decentralized oracles, tokenization, payment systems, incentives and mechanism design, AI applications in finance, peer-to-peer lending, Robo Advisers, alternative credit rating services and more.</p>

<p> The FinTeAchIn workshop aims to explore the role of education in FinTech and Innovation to better understand ongoing and potential disruptive changes, along with the challenges that must be addressed to realize the full range of anticipated and potential benefits—such as greater financial inclusion, faster and more secure transactions, and reduced operational costs. By engaging with these topics, we aim to create a meaningful learning experience for workshop participants, identify research and teaching efforts that contribute to the development, understanding, and responsible adoption of FinTech, as well as develop actionable insights that can help mitigate risks within the financial ecosystem. Academic research plays a crucial role in identifying risks early and addressing concerns about security, privacy, and regulation, but its impact is often limited because many key stakeholders do not engage directly with academic publications. Through this workshop, we seek to bridge this gap, making essential insights more accessible and actionable for practitioners, policymakers, and educators.  We expect to attract actors involved at any stage of FinTech innovation and adoption to create a multi-disciplinary space for discussing open problems, deliberate on potential solutions, and  help guide future developments in the financial industry.  </p>

<p> Interacting effectively with FinTech requires strong digital competencies, while an innovation mindset can enhance the ability to leverage emerging technologies within this field. To keep pace with emerging technologies, traditional undergraduate and graduate education programs and initiatives have started to evolve, incorporating interdisciplinary approaches that blend insights from computer science, finance, law, and sociology. This broadened perspective prepares students, researchers, and other partakers to navigate the complexities of FinTech. Continuous and executive education programs are also essential, playing a key role in building human capital and fostering innovation across the private (financial institutions and startups) and public (central banks and regulatory bodies) sectors. These programs equip individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to stay current with FinTech advancements, readying them for the challenges and opportunities in a rapidly evolving landscape. Furthermore, independent educators and content creators are increasingly targeting the general public and specific generations to make FinTech more accessible and safer. Educators use resources like podcasts, games, and age-specific books to enhance FinTech literacy across demographics, while approaches like reverse socialization, where younger generations teach older ones, may help bridge generational gaps in understanding. However, the overall impact of these approaches to enhance public understanding and trust remains to be researched.</p>
